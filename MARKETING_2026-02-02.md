```
the most romantic scene in doctor slump isn't a kiss

it's two burnt-out doctors sitting on a kitchen floor folding dumplings in silence

no background music. no confession. just two people whose hands are busy enough that their guard comes down.

korean families have known this for centuries. making mandu together isn't about food. it's about presence.

the 3 mistakes people make when folding korean mandu:

1. wet filling — if you skip squeezing water out of the cabbage, every dumpling leaks. salt it, wait 10 min, wring it dry.

2. too much filling — 1 tablespoon max. overstuffed mandu burst open during cooking and you lose everything.

3. air pockets — press from the filling outward when sealing. trapped air = the wrapper balloons and pops in the pan.

the fold takes practice. the filling takes discipline.

gun-mandu (pan-fried) vs jjin-mandu (steamed) debate:

steamed mandu people think they're being sophisticated

but that golden crispy bottom on gun-mandu — where the wrapper turns into a cracker while the top stays soft and translucent — is one of the greatest textures in all of korean cooking

steamed is elegant. pan-fried is alive.

i will not be taking questions.

**제목:** `Korean Mandu (만두) — the 3 filling mistakes that ruin homemade dumplings every time`

> 제목 레버: 구체적 숫자 (3 mistakes), 부정성 편향 (ruin), 호기심 갭 (어떤 실수?)

**본문:**
```
I make mandu at home almost every month and it took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out why mine kept falling apart or turning soggy. Here are the 3 things that finally fixed everything:

**Mistake 1: Not draining the filling enough**
Napa cabbage releases a LOT of water. Salt the chopped cabbage, wait 10 minutes, then squeeze it out with your hands until it's almost dry. Same with tofu — crumble it and press the water out. If your filling is wet, your mandu will steam from the inside and the wrappers will disintegrate.

**Mistake 2: Overstuffing**
1 tablespoon of filling per wrapper. That's it. I know it looks small, but overstuffed mandu burst at the seams during cooking. You need enough room to fold the edges together without stretching the dough thin.

**Mistake 3: Trapping air inside**
When you fold, press from the center of the filling outward toward the edges. This pushes air out. Trapped air makes the wrapper balloon during pan-frying and burst — dumping your filling into the oil.

**My go-to filling recipe:**
- 250g ground pork
- 200g firm tofu (drained and crumbled)
- 100g dangmyeon (glass noodles, soaked + chopped)
- 150g napa cabbage (salted + squeezed dry)
- 2 green onions, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp sesame oil
- Salt + pepper

Mix everything by hand. The tofu keeps it lighter than pure meat, and the glass noodles add a chewy texture that stops the filling from being one-note.

**Pan-fry method (gun-mandu):**
1. Oil in non-stick skillet, medium heat
2. Place mandu flat side down — cook 2-3 min until golden
3. Add 3 tbsp water + cover immediately (careful of splatter)
4. Steam 4-5 min with lid on
5. Remove lid, cook 30 sec more to re-crisp the bottom

**Cultural note:** Making mandu is a Korean family ritual, especially during Seollal (Lunar New Year). Everyone sits in a circle and folds hundreds of dumplings assembly-line style. Grandmas critique your technique, kids sneak raw filling, someone inevitably overstuffs a wrapper and it bursts. It's the Korean equivalent of Christmas cookie decorating — chaotic and perfect.

the food scenes in marry my husband are more important than the plot twists

in her first life, she eats alone. convenience store kimbap. rushed meals between overtime.

in her second life, she eats bossam with friends. grease on her fingers. loud. communal. messy.

the revenge isn't just about the husband. it's about learning to eat like you deserve to be fed.

the weirdest ingredient in korean bossam is instant coffee

and it's not optional

korean cooks add 2 tbsp of instant coffee to the boiling water with the pork. the tannins neutralize the gamey pork smell. the roasted compounds add depth.

doenjang goes in too — same deodorizing principle, different chemistry.

the result: pork that tastes cleaner, more refined, almost elegant.

this has been common knowledge in korea for decades and i still see zero english recipes mention it.

bossam is the most underrated korean dish in the west

not bbq. not fried chicken. not bibimbap.

BOSSAM.

tender boiled pork belly, wrapped in blanched napa cabbage with raw garlic, pickled radish, and a dab of saeujeot (fermented shrimp paste)

every bite has: soft, salty, crunchy, spicy, umami, and fermented

name another dish that hits 6 flavor dimensions in a single mouthful. i'll wait.

### Reddit r/KoreanFood

**제목:** `Bossam (보쌈) — why korean cooks add instant coffee to the boiling water (and the science behind it)`

> 제목 레버: 호기심 갭 (커피를 왜?!), 권위 (science), 패턴 깨기

**본문:**
```
I've been making bossam at home for a while, but the pork always had a slight gamey aftertaste — until I learned the coffee trick that's been standard in Korean home cooking for decades.

**The instant coffee method:**
Add 2 tablespoons of instant coffee to the boiling water along with the pork. Why? The coffee's tannins and bitter compounds bind to the molecules that cause the gamey pork smell (누린내, nureunnae). The roasted compounds add a subtle depth without tasting like coffee at all.

Most Korean cooks also add doenjang (soybean paste) to the boiling liquid — serves the same deodorizing purpose through different chemistry. The combination of coffee + doenjang gives the pork an incredibly clean, almost refined taste.

**Full bossam technique:**
1. Pork belly (1kg) in cold water — important: START COLD (gradual heating prevents the meat from seizing)
2. Add: halved onion, crushed garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, ginger, 2 tbsp doenjang, 2 tbsp instant coffee, 1 tbsp sugar
3. Bring to boil, skim foam for first 10 minutes
4. Reduce to gentle simmer — NOT a rolling boil (this is rule #1 for tender pork)
5. Cook 1 hour to 1 hour 15 min
6. Rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain

**The wraps and accompaniments are what make bossam special:**
- Blanched napa cabbage leaves
- Raw garlic slices
- Pickled radish (sugar + vinegar + gochugaru — prep 1 hour ahead)
- Ssamjang (essential)
- Saeujeot (salted fermented shrimp paste — the ultimate bossam condiment)

You assemble each wrap yourself: cabbage leaf → pork slice → pickled radish → garlic → ssamjang or saeujeot. Fold and eat in one bite.

**Why bossam is always a group meal:**
Unlike Korean BBQ where you're cooking at the table, bossam arrives ready to eat. The communal part is the wrapping — everyone reaches in, assembles their own perfect bite. It's one of Korea's most popular delivery/group dining foods, especially for late-night meals with soju.

Do you use instant coffee in your bossam? Any other tips for removing the gamey pork smell?
