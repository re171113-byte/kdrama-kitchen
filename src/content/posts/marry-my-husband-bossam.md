## The Drama: A Second Chance Tastes Like Pork Wrapped in Cabbage

She's been here before. The fluorescent lights of the hospital. The slow beep of machines. The taste of regret so thick she can feel it in her throat.

But this time, Kang Ji-won wakes up ten years in the past. And this time, she has a plan.

In tvN's *Marry My Husband* (내 남편과 결혼해줘, 2024), one of the highest-rated K-Dramas of the year, Ji-won (Park Min-young) is given the ultimate do-over. After dying from terminal cancer — betrayed by her husband and best friend who were having an affair — she's transported back to 2013. Her mission: rewrite her fate by making sure her treacherous best friend marries her terrible husband instead.

It's revenge served cold. But the meals in this drama are anything but.

*Marry My Husband* is saturated with food scenes that mark Ji-won's emotional transformation. Early in her first life, she eats alone — quick, joyless meals squeezed between overtime shifts. In her second life, she begins to eat with intention. She gathers with allies. She orders delivery. She tears into late-night bossam with colleagues who actually care about her, grease on her fingers and laughter in her voice.

Bossam — tender slices of boiled pork belly wrapped in crisp cabbage leaves with salted radish, raw garlic, and a smear of *ssamjang* — is not elegant food. It's loud, communal, messy, and unapologetically satisfying. It's the meal you eat when you've stopped caring about what other people think and started living for yourself. For Ji-won, every bite of bossam in her second life is an act of liberation.

## The History of Bossam

### What Is Bossam?

Bossam (보쌈) is Korea's beloved boiled pork belly dish — pork simmered until impossibly tender, then sliced and served with an array of wrapping leaves, pickled radish, fresh garlic, sliced chili, and dipping sauces. The name literally means "wrapped" or "bundled" (보 = wrapping cloth, 쌈 = wrap), referring to the act of wrapping the pork in lettuce or cabbage leaves.

### From Court Kitchens to Pojangmacha Tents

Bossam has roots in the Korean tradition of *suyuk* (수육, boiled meat), which dates back to the Joseon Dynasty. Boiled pork was originally a method of preparing meat for ancestral rites (*jesa*, 제사) — the simplicity of the preparation was considered respectful to the ancestors.

But bossam as we know it today — the late-night feast of sliced pork, pickled radish, and ssamjang — emerged from Seoul's *pojangmacha* (포장마차, street tent bar) culture in the latter half of the 20th century. Workers finishing late shifts would gather under orange plastic tarps, order a plate of bossam, and share soju and stories until the subway started running again.

By the 2000s, bossam had become one of Korea's most popular delivery foods. The iconic brand *Wonhalmeoni Bossam* (원할머니보쌈) turned it into a nationwide phenomenon. Today, bossam is the undisputed king of Korean group meals — ordered for office dinners, family gatherings, and any occasion that calls for communal eating.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Origin | Joseon-era suyuk tradition, evolved in 20th-century Seoul |
| Meaning | "Wrapped/bundled" — pork wrapped in leaves |
| Pork cut | Pork belly (samgyeopsal) or pork shoulder (moksal) |
| Key accompaniments | Pickled radish (bossam-kimchi), raw garlic, chili, ssamjang |
| Wrapping leaves | Napa cabbage (traditional), lettuce, perilla leaves |
| Cultural role | Late-night communal meal, delivery food staple |

### The Art of the Ssam

The beauty of bossam lies not in the pork alone, but in the *ssam* — the wrap. Each person assembles their own perfect bite: a leaf of napa cabbage, a slice of pork, a piece of pickled radish, a sliver of raw garlic, a dab of ssamjang. You fold it into a bundle and eat it in one bite. No utensils. No elegance. Just the perfect combination of tender, salty, crunchy, spicy, and fermented in a single mouthful.

This is why bossam appears in Ji-won's second life and not her first. Bossam is communal. Bossam requires people. It's the meal you share when you've found your tribe — and Ji-won's second life is defined by the relationships she builds instead of the ones she endures.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Pickled Radish**
Start this first — it needs time to marinate. Thinly slice the Korean radish into half-moon shapes. Toss with sugar, rice vinegar, gochugaru, and salt. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably longer. The radish will soften and develop a sweet-tangy-spicy crunch.

**Step 2: Boil the Pork**
Place the pork belly in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Add the halved onion, crushed garlic, peppercorns, doenjang, instant coffee, sugar, bay leaves, and sliced ginger. Yes, instant coffee — this is a classic Korean technique. The coffee tenderizes the meat, removes gamey odors, and adds a subtle roasted depth to the flavor.

**Step 3: Simmer Low and Slow**
Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Skim any foam that rises to the surface during the first 10 minutes. Cover and cook for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. The pork is done when a chopstick slides through the thickest part with no resistance.

**Step 4: Rest and Slice**
Remove the pork from the broth and let it rest for 10 minutes. Slice against the grain into pieces about 5mm thick and the width of your palm. Arrange on a warm serving plate.

**Step 5: Prepare the Wraps**
Blanch the napa cabbage leaves in boiling water for 30 seconds, then plunge into ice water. Drain well. Arrange the blanched cabbage, fresh lettuce leaves, sliced raw garlic, sliced chili, ssamjang, saeujeot, and pickled radish on separate plates around the pork.

**Step 6: Assemble and Eat**
Take a leaf. Layer a slice of pork, a piece of pickled radish, a sliver of garlic, and a dab of ssamjang or saeujeot. Fold into a bundle. Eat in one bite. Repeat until the plate is empty and the conversation is full.

## FAQ

### What's the difference between bossam and suyuk?
They're closely related. *Suyuk* (수육) refers broadly to any boiled meat — beef, pork, or even chicken. *Bossam* specifically refers to boiled pork served with wrapping leaves and accompaniments. Think of bossam as a specialized, fully-dressed version of suyuk.

### Why add instant coffee to the boiling water?
It sounds bizarre, but it's a well-known Korean cooking technique. The coffee's tannins and bitterness neutralize the pork's gamey smell (*nureunae*, 누린내), while the roasted compounds add subtle depth. Doenjang serves a similar de-odorizing purpose. Together, they make the pork taste cleaner and more refined.

### Can I use pork shoulder instead of pork belly?
Yes. Pork shoulder (*moksal*, 목살) is leaner and has a meatier texture. Many Koreans actually prefer it for bossam since it absorbs the broth flavors better. Pork belly gives richer, fattier slices. Both are traditional — it's a matter of preference.

### What is saeujeot and why is it served with bossam?
Saeujeot (새우젓) is salted fermented tiny shrimp — one of Korea's essential condiments. Its intense, briny saltiness cuts through the richness of the pork fat. A tiny dab on a slice of bossam adds an umami explosion. It's not optional — it's essential for the authentic experience.

### How do I make the pork tender, not tough?
Three rules: start with cold water (gradual heating prevents the meat from seizing), keep the simmer gentle (a rolling boil makes tough pork), and don't skip the resting time after cooking. The pork continues to tenderize as it rests, and slicing too early releases all the juices.

### Can I make bossam ahead of time?
The pork can be boiled up to a day ahead and refrigerated in its broth. When ready to serve, slice the cold pork (it's actually easier to slice cold) and briefly warm the slices in the microwave or a steamer. The accompaniments can also be prepped hours ahead. This makes bossam ideal for dinner parties.

### How is bossam eaten in Korea?
Bossam is always a shared meal. The pork plate goes in the center, surrounded by wrapping leaves, sauces, and banchan. Everyone reaches in, assembles their own wraps, and eats together. It's typically a dinner or late-night meal, often accompanied by soju. In *Marry My Husband*, the communal bossam scenes represent everything Ji-won was denied in her first life: friendship, joy, and the simple pleasure of sharing food with people who genuinely care.

## Make It Tonight

Ji-won's first life was spent eating alone — rushed meals between shifts, convenience store kimbap in an empty apartment. Her second life is defined by tables full of people and plates full of food. Bossam isn't just what she eats in her second chance — it's *how* she eats. Loudly. Communally. With grease on her fingers and people she chose beside her.

Tonight, boil the pork. Lay out the cabbage leaves. Slice the garlic. Arrange everything on the table and call the people who matter. Bossam doesn't work alone — and neither does a good life. Pick up a leaf, pile it high, fold it shut, and eat it in one glorious, messy bite. You deserve this.
