## The Drama: My Liberation Notes and the Weight of Ordinary Days

It's raining in Sanpo.

Not the dramatic, cinematic kind of rain that signals transformation or revelation. Just rain. The kind that makes the two-hour commute to Seoul feel even longer. The kind that turns the family's small furniture factory into a muddy obstacle course. The kind that has been falling on this village, these lives, for years.

Yeom Mi-jeong stands at the bus stop, umbrella in hand, face unreadable. This is her life: wake, commute, work, commute, sleep. Repeat until liberation—whatever that means.

Welcome to *My Liberation Notes* (나의 해방일지), the 2022 JTBC drama that dared to make a show about three siblings who are simply tired. Not tragically ill. Not fighting corporate conspiracies. Not caught in love triangles with chaebols. Just tired. Exhausted by the relentless ordinariness of existence.

And then there's Mr. Gu.

A mysterious man who appears in Sanpo village, drunk every day, working at the Yeom family's furniture shop, speaking almost nothing. When Mi-jeong asks him to "worship" her—not love her, worship her—something shifts. In him. In her. In the audience watching.

There are no grand romantic gestures in this drama. Instead, there are moments: sitting together in silence, watching rain fall, sharing a meal that means everything and nothing.

And on rainy nights in Korea, that meal is always **pajeon and makgeolli**.

## The History of Pajeon and Makgeolli

### Why Rainy Days?

Ask any Korean what they crave when it rains, and the answer is automatic: *pajeon* (파전, green onion pancake) and *makgeolli* (막걸리, rice wine). But why?

The answer is both poetic and practical.

**The Sound Theory**

When you pour pajeon batter into hot oil, it sizzles—*chiii*. When rain hits the roof, it sounds similar. Korean food scholar Bae Myung-jin explains that this acoustic similarity triggers a Pavlovian response. Generations of Koreans have eaten pajeon on rainy days, and now the sound of rain alone activates the craving.

**The Agricultural Origin**

In traditional agricultural Korea, farmers couldn't work in the rain. They would gather at village pavilions, and someone would inevitably bring out flour and green onions. July and August—prime monsoon season—happened to coincide with the wheat harvest. Pajeon wasn't just comfort food; it was the only food available in abundance during rainy season.

**The Science**

On low-pressure, high-humidity days, the body feels lethargic. Carbohydrate-rich foods like flour-based pancakes trigger serotonin production, improving mood. Makgeolli, being a fermented grain drink, aids digestion of the flour while providing its own mood-lifting properties.

It's a perfect storm of culture, chemistry, and coincidence.

### The History of Jeon

| Type | Korean Name | Key Ingredients | Origin |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Green Onion Pancake | 파전 (Pajeon) | Scallions, flour, egg | Modern (1970s popularization) |
| Mung Bean Pancake | 빈대떡 (Bindaetteok) | Ground mung beans | Joseon Dynasty |
| Seafood Pancake | 해물파전 (Haemul-pajeon) | Scallions, mixed seafood | Busan/coastal regions |
| Kimchi Pancake | 김치전 (Kimchijeon) | Kimchi, flour | 20th century |

Interestingly, pajeon as we know it is relatively recent. Historical cookbooks like *Gyuhap Chongseo* (규합총서) and *Eumsik Dimibang* (음식디미방) mention various *jeon* types—chive pancakes, mung bean pancakes, fish pancakes—but scallion-focused pancakes don't appear prominently until the modern era.

The seafood pajeon became particularly associated with Dongnae (now part of Busan), where legend says locals threw green onions at Japanese invaders during the Imjin War. *Dongnae pajeon* commemorates this defiance.

### The History of Makgeolli

Makgeolli is Korea's oldest alcoholic beverage, with origins stretching back over a thousand years. The name means "roughly filtered" (*mak* = roughly, *geol-li* = filtered), describing its cloudy, milky appearance.

During the Joseon Dynasty, makgeolli was called *nongju* (농주, farmer's wine) because agricultural workers drank it for energy during harvest season. It wasn't just alcohol—it was a nutritional supplement, rich in amino acids, vitamins, and probiotics from the fermentation process.

The drink fell out of fashion in the late 20th century as Korea modernized and imported beverages like beer and wine gained popularity. But in the 2000s, makgeolli experienced a dramatic revival as younger Koreans rediscovered traditional foods. Today, craft makgeolli breweries produce hundreds of varieties, from traditional to fruit-infused.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Batter**

The secret to crispy pajeon is keeping everything cold.

- Mix 1 cup pancake mix (or flour) with 1 cup ice-cold water
- Add 1 beaten egg and a pinch of salt
- Stir until just combined—lumps are fine
- The batter should be thin, like heavy cream

*Tip: Some cooks add a splash of sparkling water or beer for extra crispiness.*

**Step 2: Prepare the Ingredients**

- Cut green onions into 4-5 inch lengths (as long as your pan allows)
- Clean and prep seafood: devein shrimp, slice squid into rings
- Slice red chili on a diagonal for visual appeal

**Step 3: Heat the Pan**

- Heat a large pan over medium-high heat
- Add enough oil to generously coat the bottom (about 3 tbsp)
- The oil should shimmer but not smoke

**Step 4: Lay the Onions**

Here's where pajeon differs from Western pancakes:

- Arrange green onions in a single layer, side by side, in the pan
- They should extend slightly beyond where the batter will reach
- This creates the signature "onion extending from pancake" look

**Step 5: Add Batter and Seafood**

- Pour batter over the onions in a thin, even layer
- Immediately place seafood pieces on top
- Add sliced red chili for color
- Press everything gently into the batter

**Step 6: Flip When Golden**

- Cook for 3-4 minutes until the bottom is golden and crispy
- Shake the pan to loosen—if it moves freely, it's ready
- Carefully flip using a wide spatula
- Press down gently to ensure contact with the pan
- Cook another 3-4 minutes

**Step 7: Make the Dipping Sauce**

While the pajeon finishes cooking:

- Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, and gochugaru
- Add a pinch of sesame seeds
- Adjust to taste

**Step 8: Serve**

- Slide onto a cutting board
- Cut into wedges or squares
- Serve immediately with dipping sauce
- Pour makgeolli into traditional bowls
- Listen to the rain

## FAQ

### Why is ice-cold water important for the batter?

Cold water prevents gluten development, resulting in a crispier pancake. Gluten makes batter chewy—great for bread, not for jeon. Some recipes even add ice cubes directly to the batter.

### Can I make pajeon without seafood?

Absolutely. *Pajeon* in its simplest form is just scallions, batter, and oil. You can also add kimchi (*kimchijeon*), vegetables (*yachaejeon*), or make it completely vegan. The seafood version (*haemul-pajeon*) is popular at restaurants but not essential.

### What's the best pan for pajeon?

A wide, flat-bottomed pan works best. Cast iron retains heat well but requires more oil. Non-stick is easier for beginners. Traditional Korean *jeon* pans are shallow and wide, designed for this exact purpose.

### How do I get my pajeon extra crispy?

Tips for maximum crispiness:
1. Use ice-cold water or sparkling water
2. Don't overmix the batter
3. Use plenty of oil
4. Cook over medium-high heat
5. Press down gently while cooking
6. Don't flip until the bottom is truly golden

### What's the proper way to drink makgeolli?

Makgeolli settles, so shake or stir before serving. Traditionally, it's served in a bowl rather than a glass, and you drink from the bowl. The communal aspect is important—pour for others before yourself, and don't drink alone (unless you're Mr. Gu).

### Why do makgeolli and pajeon go so well together?

Beyond tradition, there's science. Makgeolli contains enzymes from the fermentation process that help break down the starch in flour-based foods, aiding digestion. The slight sweetness and tanginess of makgeolli also balances the savory, oily richness of jeon.

## Make It Tonight

*My Liberation Notes* asks a simple question: What does it mean to be free?

For Mi-jeong, liberation isn't a grand escape. It's small moments of peace. It's someone who sits with her in silence. It's watching the rain fall and feeling, for just a moment, that the weight of ordinary days has lifted.

In Korea, rainy days have always been an excuse to pause. When the sky opens up, the rushing stops. You can't commute efficiently. You can't work outside. All you can do is gather with others, fry something delicious, pour something cloudy, and wait for the weather to change.

Tonight, if it's raining—or even if it isn't—try this ritual. Make pajeon slowly. Let the batter sizzle like rain on a hot roof. Pour makgeolli into bowls, not glasses. Sit with someone you love, or sit alone if that's what you need.

Liberation doesn't always roar. Sometimes it sizzles.

오늘 밤, *나의 해방일지*의 미정이처럼 빗소리를 들으며 파전에 막걸리 한 잔, 어떠세요?
