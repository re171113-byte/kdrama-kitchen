## The Drama: Let's Eat and the Art of Eating Alone

It's 9 PM on a Wednesday.

You're scrolling through your phone, trying to decide what to order for dinner. The apartment is quiet—just you and the hum of the refrigerator. Sound familiar?

This is the world of *Let's Eat* (식샤를 합시다), the 2013 drama that revolutionized how Korea—and eventually the world—thought about eating alone. Before mukbang became a global phenomenon, before ASMR eating videos flooded YouTube, there was Goo Dae-young, a man with an almost supernatural ability to describe food in ways that made your stomach growl through the screen.

The drama follows Lee Soo-kyung, a divorced insurance investigator living alone, and her eccentric neighbor Goo Dae-young, whose food descriptions are so vivid they should come with a warning label. When Dae-young talks about the way *gochujang* coats each grain of rice, how the *namul* vegetables release their earthy sweetness as you mix—you don't just watch. You *crave*.

And no dish captures this drama's essence better than **bibimbap**.

## The History of Bibimbap

### What Is Bibimbap?

*Bibimbap* (비빔밥) literally means "mixed rice"—*bibim* (비빔) for mixing, *bap* (밥) for rice. But calling bibimbap "mixed rice" is like calling the Mona Lisa "a painting of a woman." Technically accurate, spiritually inadequate.

This dish is a canvas of color and texture: warm rice crowned with an array of sautéed vegetables, a protein of your choice, a golden fried egg, and the crucial element—a generous dollop of *gochujang* (Korean red pepper paste). The magic happens when you take your spoon and destroy this beautiful arrangement, mixing everything into a harmonious, slightly messy, absolutely delicious bowl.

### A Royal Beginning

Bibimbap's origins trace back to the Joseon Dynasty, though the exact birth story remains debated. The earliest written records appear in the 1800s—*Siuijeonseo* (시의전서), a cookbook from that era, documents the dish as *goldongban* (골동반), meaning "rice mixed with various ingredients."

| Historical Name | Meaning | Source |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Goldongban (骨董飯) | Antique rice | Cheongdae Ilgi, 1700s |
| Hondunban (混沌飯) | Chaos rice | Gijae Japgi, 1600s |
| Bibimbap (비빔밥) | Mixed rice | Modern usage |

Some historians believe bibimbap originated as a royal court dish—a way to present the king with a variety of *banchan* (side dishes) in a single, elegant bowl. Others argue it was farmers' food, a practical way to use up leftover vegetables during busy harvest seasons.

The truth? Probably both. Great dishes have a way of transcending class.

### Jeonju vs. Jinju: The Bibimbap Rivalry

Korea takes bibimbap seriously enough to have regional rivalries. The two most famous versions come from Jeonju and Jinju.

**Jeonju Bibimbap** (전주비빔밥):
- Rice cooked in beef bone broth
- Famous for its *hwangpo-muk* (yellow mung bean jelly)
- Accompanied by *kongnamul-guk* (bean sprout soup)
- Uses local Jeonju bean sprouts, renowned for their crunch

**Jinju Bibimbap** (진주비빔밥):
- Also called *hwaban* (flower rice) for its beautiful presentation
- Topped with *yukhoe* (Korean beef tartare)
- Served with *haejangguk* (blood soup) on the side
- Legend says it originated during the Imjin War at Jinjuseong Fortress

The oldest surviving bibimbap restaurant in Korea? That would be Cheonhwang Sikdang in Jinju, serving since 1915.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Namul (Vegetables)**

Each vegetable is prepared separately to maintain its distinct flavor and texture:

*Spinach Namul:*
- Blanch spinach in boiling salted water for 30 seconds
- Immediately plunge into ice water
- Squeeze out excess water thoroughly
- Season with 1 tsp sesame oil, ½ tsp minced garlic, pinch of salt

*Bean Sprout Namul:*
- Boil bean sprouts for 3-4 minutes until tender-crisp
- Drain and season with sesame oil, garlic, and salt

*Carrot and Zucchini:*
- Sauté separately in a little oil with a pinch of salt
- Cook until just softened, maintaining slight crunch
- Season with a drop of sesame oil

*Mushrooms:*
- Sauté with a splash of soy sauce until fragrant
- Add a touch of sesame oil at the end

**Step 2: Prepare the Meat**

Mix ground beef with:
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- Black pepper to taste

Sauté over medium-high heat until cooked through. Set aside.

**Step 3: Make the Bibimbap Sauce**

In a small bowl, combine:
- 2 tbsp gochujang
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp water
- 1 tsp rice vinegar (optional, for brightness)

Mix well until smooth. Adjust sweetness and spice to your preference.

**Step 4: Fry the Egg**

Fry an egg sunny-side up. The runny yolk will become part of the sauce when you mix—pure liquid gold.

**Step 5: Assemble**

Place hot rice in a bowl. Arrange each namul in separate sections around the rice like a color wheel—think of it as edible art. Place the meat in the center, top with the fried egg, and add a generous spoonful of bibimbap sauce.

**Step 6: The Ritual**

Now comes the moment of truth. Take your spoon, add more sesame oil if desired, and **mix everything together**. Don't be gentle. The beauty was meant to be destroyed.

*Goo Dae-young's voice: "Listen to that sound. The vegetables releasing their moisture, the sauce coating every grain, the egg yolk binding it all together. This... this is bibimbap."*

## FAQ

### What's the difference between regular bibimbap and dolsot bibimbap?

Dolsot bibimbap is served in a sizzling hot stone pot (*dolsot*). The intense heat creates a crispy rice crust called *nurungji* at the bottom—the best part. Regular bibimbap comes in a regular bowl without the crispy rice element.

### Can I make bibimbap vegetarian or vegan?

Absolutely! Bibimbap is naturally adaptable. Skip the meat and egg, add tofu or extra mushrooms. Some Korean temples serve *sanchae bibimbap* with mountain vegetables—completely vegan and deeply flavorful.

### What vegetables can I use if I can't find Korean ingredients?

Use whatever you have! The principle is variety in color and texture. Cucumber, bell peppers, kale, or even leftover roasted vegetables work well. The sauce and sesame oil will tie everything together.

### Why do you prepare each vegetable separately?

Each vegetable has its own cooking time and seasoning. Preparing them separately preserves their individual characters while creating a more complex final dish. It's more work, but the difference is noticeable.

### How do I get crispy rice in dolsot bibimbap at home?

Heat your stone bowl (or cast iron skillet) on the stove, brush with sesame oil, add rice, and let it sit on medium-low heat for 5-7 minutes before adding toppings. You'll hear it sizzle—that's your *nurungji* forming.

### What's the proper way to eat bibimbap?

Mix it thoroughly before eating—that's non-negotiable. Some people like to mix only the portion they're about to eat, keeping the rest pretty. In *Let's Eat* style? Destroy the whole bowl immediately and dig in.

### Can I meal prep bibimbap?

Yes! Prepare the namul vegetables ahead and store separately. They keep well for 3-4 days refrigerated. Assemble with fresh rice and a newly fried egg when ready to eat.

## Make It Tonight

There's something deeply satisfying about bibimbap that goes beyond nutrition. It's the ritual of preparation—each vegetable tended to individually. It's the moment of artistic arrangement, knowing you're about to destroy it. It's the meditative act of mixing, turning chaos into harmony.

In *Let's Eat*, food isn't just sustenance. It's connection, comfort, therapy. Goo Dae-young doesn't just eat—he experiences. He closes his eyes. He savors. He makes everyone around him hungry.

Tonight, try eating alone. Not scrolling through your phone, not watching TV mindlessly. Just you and your bibimbap. Pay attention to the textures, the way the gochujang's heat builds, the nutty depth of sesame oil.

You might find, like Soo-kyung eventually does, that eating alone isn't lonely at all.

오늘 밤, *식샤를 합시다*처럼 정성스럽게 만든 비빔밥 한 그릇과 함께 나만의 먹방을 즐겨보는 건 어떨까요?
