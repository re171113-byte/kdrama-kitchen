## The Drama: When Revenge Is Served Cold

*The Glory* (더 글로리) arrived on Netflix in December 2022 and shattered viewing records worldwide. Within weeks, it became the most-watched non-English series on the platform, with over 622 million hours viewed.

Moon Dong-eun (Song Hye-kyo) was once a high school student with dreams of becoming an architect. Then Park Yeon-jin and her group of wealthy friends chose her as their target. The violence they inflicted—burning her with curling irons, breaking her spirit—forced her to abandon school and her dreams.

Eighteen years later, Dong-eun returns. Not as a victim, but as the homeroom teacher of Yeon-jin's daughter. The revenge she has meticulously planned is about to unfold.

Throughout *The Glory*, food appears in moments of sharp contrast. The bullies dine at expensive restaurants, celebrating their privilege. Dong-eun eats alone, simple meals that fuel her singular purpose. But at the heart of Korean celebrations—birthdays, holidays, gatherings where families pretend everything is fine—there is always *japchae*.

In Korean culture, japchae appears at every significant gathering. It's the dish that says "this moment matters." In a drama about facades and hidden truths, japchae sits on tables where smiles mask cruelty, where celebration masks guilt.

## The History of Japchae

### What Is Japchae?

Japchae (잡채) translates literally as "mixed vegetables"—*jap* (잡/雜) meaning "mixed" and *chae* (채/菜) meaning "vegetables." But this simple translation belies the dish's complexity and royal origins.

At its heart, japchae is glass noodles (dangmyeon) stir-fried with an array of colorful vegetables and meat, seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil. The noodles, made from sweet potato starch, are uniquely Korean—translucent, chewy, and capable of absorbing flavors while maintaining their distinctive texture.

### From Royal Court to Every Korean Table

Unlike many Korean dishes with murky origins, japchae has a documented birthdate: 1608.

During the reign of King Gwanghaegun, a court official named Yi Chung prepared a unique dish for a royal banquet. The king was so impressed that he promoted Yi Chung on the spot. The original japchae, however, contained no noodles at all—it was purely a dish of stir-fried vegetables and mushrooms.

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **1608** | Yi Chung creates original japchae for King Gwanghaegun |
| **Early 1900s** | Sweet potato noodles (dangmyeon) introduced from China |
| **1930s** | Modern japchae with glass noodles becomes standard |
| **Present** | Essential dish at Korean celebrations worldwide |

The addition of glass noodles came much later, in the early 20th century, when sweet potato starch noodles were introduced from China. The combination proved irresistible, and this version quickly became the standard.

### Why Japchae Means Celebration

In Korea, certain dishes carry cultural weight beyond their ingredients. Japchae is *janchi* (잔치) food—celebration food. You'll find it at:

- **Seollal** (Lunar New Year)
- **Chuseok** (Korean Thanksgiving)
- **Dol-janchi** (first birthday celebrations)
- **Weddings**
- **Hwangap** (60th birthday celebrations)

The dish requires significant preparation—each vegetable must be cooked separately to maintain its color and texture, then combined with the noodles. This labor-intensive process itself signals importance: "I cared enough to make this properly."

### The Philosophy of Separate Cooking

Traditional japchae follows a principle called *따로따로* (*ttaro-ttaro*)—"separately, separately." Each ingredient is prepared individually:

- Spinach is blanched and seasoned
- Carrots are sautéed until just tender
- Mushrooms are cooked with soy sauce
- Beef is marinated and stir-fried
- Noodles are cooked and seasoned

Only at the end are all components combined and tossed together. This method preserves each ingredient's integrity while allowing them to harmonize in the final dish. It's a metaphor for Korean family dynamics—individual identities maintained within collective unity.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Sauce**
In a small bowl, combine soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, minced garlic, and black pepper. Mix until sugar dissolves. Set aside.

**Step 2: Marinate the Beef**
Slice beef into thin strips. Toss with 1 tablespoon of the prepared sauce. Let marinate while you prep other ingredients.

**Step 3: Prepare the Egg Garnish**
Separate egg yolks from whites. Cook each separately in a lightly oiled pan to make thin omelets. Roll and slice into thin strips. Set aside.

**Step 4: Cook the Noodles**
Bring a large pot of water to boil. Cook glass noodles for 6-7 minutes until translucent and chewy. Drain and rinse with cold water. Using kitchen scissors, cut the noodles into manageable lengths. Toss with 2 tablespoons of the sauce.

**Step 5: Cook Vegetables Separately**
This is the key to great japchae—each vegetable gets individual attention.

- **Spinach**: Blanch for 30 seconds, squeeze dry, season with a pinch of salt and sesame oil
- **Carrots**: Sauté in oil for 2 minutes, season with salt
- **Mushrooms**: Sauté with 1 tablespoon soy sauce until fragrant
- **Onion & Bell Pepper**: Sauté briefly, keeping some crunch
- **Beef**: Stir-fry over high heat until just cooked

**Step 6: Combine Everything**
In a large mixing bowl, add the seasoned noodles. Add all cooked vegetables and beef. Pour remaining sauce over everything. Using your hands (the traditional way) or tongs, gently toss until everything is evenly combined.

**Step 7: Finish and Serve**
Transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with egg strips and toasted sesame seeds. Japchae can be served warm, at room temperature, or cold—it's delicious at any temperature.

## FAQ

### Why do the noodles get sticky after cooking?

Glass noodles continue to absorb moisture and can stick together as they cool. The solution: toss them with sesame oil and some sauce immediately after cooking. If reheating, add a splash of water and microwave briefly.

### Can I make japchae ahead of time?

Yes—japchae is actually one of the few Korean dishes that tastes great at room temperature or cold. Make it several hours ahead for parties. Store covered at room temperature for same-day serving, or refrigerate for up to 3 days.

### What are glass noodles made of?

Korean glass noodles (dangmyeon) are made from sweet potato starch, giving them their distinctive chewy texture and ability to stay bouncy even when cold. They're different from rice noodles or mung bean noodles.

### Is japchae gluten-free?

Traditional japchae can be made gluten-free by using tamari or gluten-free soy sauce. The glass noodles themselves are naturally gluten-free as they're made from sweet potato starch.

### Why cook each vegetable separately?

The *ttaro-ttaro* method ensures each vegetable is cooked to its ideal doneness and retains its color. Spinach needs only seconds; carrots need longer. Cooking together would result in some ingredients overdone and others underdone.

### What's the significance of japchae in The Glory?

In *The Glory*, japchae appears at gatherings where appearances matter—birthday parties, holiday celebrations, social events where the bullies maintain their facade of respectability. It represents the Korean tradition of celebrating together, even when the relationships beneath are fractured.

### Can I make japchae vegetarian?

Absolutely. Omit the beef and add more mushrooms—both shiitake and wood ear mushrooms work beautifully. Some versions also include tofu. The dish is just as celebratory without meat.

## Make It Tonight

*The Glory* taught us that some wounds never fully heal. That revenge, when served with patience, can be a dish best served cold. That the people who hurt you may never face justice—unless you become the architect of that justice yourself.

Japchae is the opposite of revenge. It's a dish that requires patience not for destruction, but for creation. Each vegetable prepared with care. Each component given its due attention. The final result a harmony of colors and textures that could only come from deliberate, loving effort.

Make this dish for your next celebration. Or make it for a quiet night when you need to remember that some things in life are still beautiful, still worth the effort.
