## Why This Scene Went Viral

The ramyeon scene in Episode 4 wasn't just about food—it was about connection. In Korean culture, asking someone "Do you want to eat ramyeon?" has romantic undertones (similar to "Netflix and chill" in Western culture).

When Captain Ri cooked ramyeon for Se-ri in his modest North Korean home, it represented:
- **Care and hospitality** despite limited resources
- **Breaking down barriers** between two people from different worlds
- **Simple pleasures** in difficult times

- 2 cups water (500ml)

## Step-by-Step Recipe

### Step 1: Boil the Water
Bring 2 cups of water to a rolling boil in a small pot. Korean-style pots (called "ttukbaegi") work best, but any pot will do.

### Step 2: Add the Soup Base
Once boiling, add the soup powder and vegetable flakes that come with your ramyeon pack. Stir well.

### Step 3: Add the Noodles
Drop in the noodles and let them cook for about 2 minutes without stirring too much. This keeps the noodles from breaking.

### Step 4: The Egg (Captain Ri Style)
Here's the key moment! Crack an egg directly into the center of the pot. **Don't stir it**—let it poach gently in the broth for about 1 minute.

### Step 5: Final Touch
Add chopped green onions and remove from heat while the noodles still have a slight bite to them. They'll continue cooking in the hot broth.

## Pro Tips for Perfect K-Drama Ramyeon

### 1. Don't Overcook the Noodles
Korean ramyeon should be slightly chewy (called "al dente" in Italian). Remove from heat 30 seconds before the package instructions say.

### 2. Use a Lid for the Egg
Place a lid on the pot for the last minute to help the egg white set while keeping the yolk runny.

### 3. Eat Directly from the Pot
For the authentic experience, place the pot on a trivet and eat directly from it—just like they do in K-Dramas. The pot keeps everything hot until the last bite.

### 4. Add Cheese for Extra Comfort
Many Koreans add a slice of American cheese on top. It melts into a creamy, savory layer that's absolutely addictive.

| Shared meal | Intimacy and connection |
| Budget food | Accessible to everyone |
| Nostalgic | Reminds Koreans of student days |

## FAQ

### Q1. What brand of ramyeon was used in Crash Landing on You?
While not explicitly shown, most K-Dramas use either **Shin Ramyun** or **Jin Ramen** due to their iconic red packaging and recognizable taste.

### Q2. Can I make this vegetarian?
Yes! Use vegetable-based ramyeon (like Samyang Vegetable Ramyeon) and skip the egg, or use a plant-based egg alternative.

### Q3. Why do Koreans eat ramyeon from the pot?
It keeps the noodles hot longer and creates a communal eating experience. Plus, it means fewer dishes to wash!

### Q4. What does "ramyeon meokgo gallae" mean?
This phrase (라면 먹고 갈래?) literally means "Do you want to come in for ramyeon?" but it's often used as a romantic invitation—similar to asking someone up for coffee.

### Q5. How spicy is Korean ramyeon?
Most Korean ramyeon is moderately spicy. Shin Ramyun is considered medium-hot, while Jin Ramen (mild) is better for those sensitive to spice.
