There's something intimate about sharing a meal with a stranger.

Not the awkward small talk of a business lunch or the performative politeness of a first date. Something simpler. Two people, one table, good food, and the unspoken agreement that for the next hour, neither of you has to be alone.

This is the world of *Dinner Mate* (저녁 같이 드실래요), a 2020 drama that understands what so many others miss: sometimes the most profound connections begin not with grand gestures, but with a quiet question—"Would you like to have dinner together?"

Kim Hae-kyung (Song Seung-heon) and Woo Do-hee (Seo Ji-hye) are strangers bound by circumstance. Both nursing their own heartbreaks. Both tired of eating alone. When they agree to become "dinner mates"—sharing meals with no strings attached—they discover that food has a way of healing wounds that words cannot reach.

And at the center of their story sits Korea's most beloved dish: **bulgogi**.

## The History of Bulgogi

### What Is Bulgogi?

*Bulgogi* (불고기) literally translates to "fire meat"—*bul* (fire) and *gogi* (meat). But don't let the name fool you. Unlike the aggressive char of Western grilling, bulgogi is about subtlety. Thin slices of beef, marinated until the fibers surrender to sweetness, then kissed by flame just long enough to caramelize the edges while keeping the center impossibly tender.

It's the dish Korean grandmothers make when they want to say "I love you" without speaking. The dish that appears at celebrations and quiet Tuesday dinners alike. The dish that, more than any other, represents Korean cuisine to the world.

### From Royal Courts to Family Tables

Bulgogi's origins stretch back to the Goguryeo era (37 BC – 668 AD), when it was called *maekjeok* (맥적)—skewered meat grilled over fire. By the Joseon Dynasty, it had evolved into *neobiani* (너비아니), a dish reserved for royalty. Only the aristocracy could afford such tender cuts of beef, marinated in soy sauce, sesame oil, and pear juice.

But Korea democratized its cuisine long before it democratized its politics. As the country industrialized, beef became accessible to ordinary families. Bulgogi moved from palace kitchens to street vendors to home dinner tables. Today, it's served everywhere from upscale restaurants to convenience store lunch boxes.

| Era | Name | Status |
|-----|------|--------|
| Goguryeo (37 BC) | Maekjeok | Commoner food |
| Joseon Dynasty | Neobiani | Royal cuisine |
| Modern Korea | Bulgogi | National dish |

### The Secret Is in the Marinade

What separates good bulgogi from transcendent bulgogi is patience. The marinade—a careful balance of soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, and Asian pear—needs time to work its magic. The enzymes in the pear break down the meat's proteins, creating that signature melt-in-your-mouth texture that no amount of pounding or slicing can replicate.

In *Dinner Mate*, when Hae-kyung and Do-hee share bulgogi, they're not just eating beef. They're participating in centuries of culinary tradition, each bite a reminder that some things—like good food and unexpected connections—are worth waiting for.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Slice the Beef**

If your butcher hasn't done it for you, partially freeze the beef for 30 minutes—this makes thin slicing much easier. Cut against the grain into 3mm slices. Thinner is better; the marinade penetrates more deeply, and the meat cooks faster.

**Step 2: Make the Marinade**

In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, grated pear, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, rice wine, grated onion, and black pepper. Whisk until the sugar dissolves completely.

*Pro tip: The pear is non-negotiable. Its enzymes are what transform tough beef into silk. If you can't find Asian pear, use half a kiwi—it has similar tenderizing properties.*

**Step 3: Marinate**

Add the sliced beef to the marinade, making sure every piece is coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours—overnight is ideal. The longer it marinates, the more flavorful and tender the meat becomes.

**Step 4: Cook**

Heat your grill pan or skillet over high heat until smoking. Working in batches (don't overcrowd), spread the beef in a single layer. Let it sizzle undisturbed for 1-2 minutes until the edges caramelize, then flip and cook another minute.

The goal is a slight char on the outside while keeping the inside juicy. Overcooking is the enemy of good bulgogi.

**Step 5: Serve**

Transfer to a warm plate, garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions. Serve immediately with steamed rice, lettuce leaves for wrapping, and *ssamjang* (Korean dipping sauce).

## FAQ

### Can I use a different cut of beef?
Yes! While sirloin and ribeye are traditional, beef tenderloin works beautifully for a special occasion. For a budget-friendly option, try beef chuck—it has more fat, which adds flavor, though it may be slightly chewier.

### What if I don't have Asian pear?
Kiwi is the best substitute—use half a kiwi for 500g of beef. You can also use fresh pineapple juice, though use sparingly as it's more aggressive. In a pinch, a tablespoon of honey with a splash of apple cider vinegar mimics the sweetness and acidity.

### How long should I marinate the beef?
Minimum 2 hours, maximum 24 hours. Longer marinating intensifies flavor, but don't exceed 24 hours or the meat may become mushy from the fruit enzymes.

### Can I make bulgogi in the oven?
Yes! Spread marinated beef on a baking sheet lined with foil. Broil on high for 3-4 minutes per side, watching carefully to prevent burning. It won't have the same smokiness as grilled, but it's a valid alternative.

### What's the traditional way to eat bulgogi?
Wrap a piece of meat in a lettuce leaf with a slice of garlic, a dab of *ssamjang*, and a bit of rice. Fold it into a bite-sized parcel and eat it whole. This is called *ssam* (쌈), and it's the most satisfying way to enjoy Korean BBQ.

### Is bulgogi gluten-free?
Traditional soy sauce contains wheat, so no. However, you can substitute with tamari or coconut aminos for a gluten-free version that's nearly indistinguishable from the original.

### Can I freeze marinated bulgogi?
Absolutely! In fact, freezing while marinated is a great meal-prep strategy. The meat continues to absorb flavors as it thaws. Freeze for up to 3 months; thaw overnight in the refrigerator before cooking.
