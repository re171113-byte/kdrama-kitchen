It's a cold winter evening in Ssangmun-dong, 1988.

The narrow alleyways are alive with the sounds of children playing, mothers calling their kids home for dinner, and the distant hum of a television broadcasting the Seoul Olympics. At the corner of the neighborhood, steam rises from a *pojangmacha* cart, where an elderly woman serves up plates of sliced sundae with salt and liver.

This is the world of *Reply 1988*—a world where neighbors are family, where doors are never locked, and where a plate of sundae shared among friends means everything.

## The Drama: *Reply 1988* and the Soul of a Neighborhood

*Reply 1988* (응답하라 1988) isn't just a drama. It's a time machine.

Set in the Ssangmun-dong neighborhood of Seoul, the show follows five families living in a tight-knit alley community. The Sung family, the Kim family, the Choi family, the Ryu family, and the Sung family next door—their lives intertwine in ways both hilarious and heartbreaking.

Food isn't just present in *Reply 1988*—it's the language through which love is expressed. When words fail, a bowl of soup appears at your door. When times are hard, neighbors share whatever little they have. And when friends gather after school, nothing beats a steaming plate of sundae from the local street vendor.

The drama captures a Korea that existed before smartphones, before high-speed internet, before the economic boom transformed Seoul into a megacity. It's a Korea where sundae was the ultimate after-school snack, where sharing food meant sharing your heart.

## The History of Sundae

### What Is Sundae?

*Sundae* (순대, pronounced "soon-dae," not like the ice cream dessert) is Korean blood sausage—a tube of pig intestine stuffed with a mixture of glass noodles, vegetables, and pig's blood, then steamed until firm.

If that description makes you hesitant, you're not alone. Many foreigners approach sundae with caution. But one bite of the soft, savory filling wrapped in tender casing, dipped in salt mixed with pepper or *tteokbokki* sauce, and hesitation turns to devotion.

### A Food with Ancient Roots

Sundae's origins trace back centuries, with some historians linking it to Mongol influence during the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392). Blood sausages exist across cultures—from European *boudin noir* to British black pudding—but Korean sundae developed its own distinct character.

During the Joseon Dynasty, sundae was considered a delicacy, often prepared for special occasions. The intestine casing was precious, and the filling—rice, vegetables, and blood—made use of every part of the animal, reflecting the Korean philosophy of waste-nothing cooking.

### Street Food Evolution

By the 1980s—the era of *Reply 1988*—sundae had become the quintessential Korean street food. *Pojangmacha* carts dotted every neighborhood, serving sundae sliced into rounds, accompanied by liver, lung, and a dipping mixture of salt and pepper.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Casing**

If using natural pig intestine, rinse thoroughly inside and out with salt and flour. Repeat 3-4 times until the smell is gone and the casing is clean. Soak in cold water with a splash of vinegar for 30 minutes.

**Step 2: Make the Filling**

In a large bowl, combine the soaked glass noodles (cut into 3-inch pieces), pig's blood (or crumbled firm tofu), cooked glutinous rice, blanched bean sprouts, green onions, and garlic. Add sesame oil, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly with your hands until everything is evenly distributed.

**Step 3: Stuff the Casing**

Tie one end of the casing with kitchen twine. Using a funnel or piping bag, carefully stuff the filling into the casing. Don't overfill—the filling will expand during cooking. Tie the other end when about 80% full.

**Step 4: Steam**

Place the stuffed sundae in a steamer over boiling water. Steam for 40-50 minutes, turning once halfway through. The sundae is done when the casing is firm and the filling is cooked through.

**Step 5: Rest and Slice**

Let the sundae cool for 10 minutes before slicing into 1-inch rounds. Serve with the salt-pepper dip.

## FAQ

### What does sundae taste like?

Sundae has a mild, savory flavor. The glass noodles provide a chewy texture, while the blood adds earthiness and richness. The casing offers a satisfying snap. When dipped in salt and pepper, the flavors become more pronounced and slightly addictive.

### Is sundae safe to eat?

Yes, when properly cooked. The blood is fully coagulated and steamed at high temperatures, making it safe to consume. Commercial sundae in Korea follows strict food safety standards.

### Can I make sundae without blood?

Absolutely. Many modern recipes substitute firm tofu for blood, which provides similar texture without the iron-rich taste. The result is milder but still delicious.

### Where can I buy sundae in Korea?

Sundae is available everywhere—traditional markets, street vendors, specialized *sundae* restaurants, and even convenience stores sell packaged versions. Gwangjang Market in Seoul is famous for its sundae alley.

### What's the best way to eat sundae?

Traditionally, sundae is eaten with a dip of salt mixed with black pepper. Some people prefer *ssamjang* (spicy paste) or *tteokbokki* sauce. In *sundae-guk* (sundae soup), sliced sundae is served in a rich bone broth.

### How long does sundae keep?

Fresh sundae should be eaten within 1-2 days when refrigerated. It can be frozen for up to a month. Reheat by steaming or pan-frying.
