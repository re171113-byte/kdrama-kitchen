You know that feeling.

You're walking through a crowded Korean market, the air thick with the smell of sizzling oil and caramelizing sauce. Steam rises from metal carts. Vendors call out in rapid Korean. And then you see them—golden-brown skewers lined up in perfect rows, glistening with a glossy red-orange sauce that promises equal parts sweet and spicy.

This is the world of Korean street food. And at its heart sits **sotteok sotteok** (소떡소떡)—the playfully named snack that has captured the hearts of K-drama fans and food lovers alike.

In *True Beauty* (여신강림), the 2020 drama that taught us all that confidence is the best makeup, food scenes aren't just filler—they're emotional anchors. When Lim Ju-kyung (Moon Ga-young) and her friends gather around steaming plates of tteokbokki at their favorite bunsik restaurant, we see more than teenagers eating. We see friendship. Comfort. The simple joy of sharing something delicious with people who accept you as you are.

Sotteok sotteok embodies that same spirit. It's unpretentious. It's fun. And it's absolutely irresistible.

## The History of Sotteok Sotteok

### What Is Sotteok Sotteok?

The name tells you everything you need to know. *So* (소) comes from *sosiji* (소시지)—sausage. *Tteok* (떡) means rice cake. Put them together and you get *so-tteok so-tteok*—a playful repetition that mimics the alternating pattern of sausages and rice cakes on the skewer.

This isn't ancient Korean cuisine. Sotteok sotteok is a modern invention, born from the creative chaos of Korean highway rest stops (*hyugeso*) where weary drivers stop for quick, satisfying snacks. Legend credits comedian Lee Young-ja with popularizing it on the variety show *Knowing Bros* in 2017, after which sotteok sotteok stalls began appearing everywhere from Seoul's Myeongdong to small-town markets.

### The Perfect Marriage of Textures

What makes sotteok sotteok special isn't complexity—it's contrast. The rice cakes offer that signature *tteok* chewiness: bouncy, slightly sticky, with a satisfying resistance that gives way to softness. The sausages provide snap and savory depth. Together, they create a textural symphony that keeps you reaching for another bite.

Then comes the sauce. Sweet from corn syrup or honey. Spicy from *gochujang*. Tangy from ketchup. It caramelizes on the hot skewer, creating a glossy coat that makes every piece glisten like candy.

| Element | Texture | Flavor |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Rice cake (tteok) | Chewy, bouncy | Mild, slightly sweet |
| Sausage (sosiji) | Snappy, juicy | Savory, umami |
| Sauce | Sticky, glossy | Sweet-spicy-tangy |

### Why It Works in True Beauty

*True Beauty* is fundamentally about masks—the ones we wear to face the world, and the courage it takes to remove them. Ju-kyung's transformation from "ugly duckling" to beauty influencer is just the surface story. Beneath it lies a deeper truth: real connection happens when we stop pretending.

Street food like sotteok sotteok represents that authenticity. No fancy plating. No pretension. Just honest, delicious food shared between friends. When the characters in *True Beauty* gather around a table of Korean snacks, they're stripped of their public personas. They're just hungry teenagers, laughing with full mouths, reaching across the table for one more skewer.

That's the magic of Korean street food. It makes everyone equal.

### Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the Rice Cakes**

If using frozen rice cakes, place them in a microwave-safe bowl with enough water to cover. Microwave for 2-3 minutes until soft and pliable. If using refrigerated rice cakes, blanch them in boiling water for 1-2 minutes. Drain and set aside.

*Street vendor tip: The rice cakes should be soft enough to easily pierce with a skewer but not so soft they fall apart. Think firm tofu texture.*

**Step 2: Prepare the Sausages**

Cut mini sausages into pieces roughly the same length as your rice cakes (about 3-4cm). If using regular hot dogs, cut them into thirds. Make shallow diagonal cuts on each piece—this helps them cook evenly and hold more sauce.

**Step 3: Assemble the Skewers**

Thread rice cakes and sausages alternately onto wooden skewers. A typical skewer has 3-4 rice cakes and 3 sausages. Start and end with rice cake for the classic look. Don't pack them too tightly—leave a tiny gap for even cooking.

**Step 4: Make the Sauce**

In a small bowl, combine gochujang, ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Mix until smooth. The consistency should be thick enough to coat but thin enough to brush. Add a splash of water if too thick.

**Step 5: Cook the Skewers**

Heat oil in a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Place skewers in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, rotating to get all surfaces golden brown. The rice cakes should develop a light crust while staying chewy inside.

For extra crispiness, press down gently with a spatula while cooking.

**Step 6: Glaze and Serve**

While the skewers are still hot, brush generously with the sauce on all sides. Return to the pan for 30 seconds to caramelize the sauce slightly. Transfer to a plate, sprinkle with sesame seeds, and drizzle with extra sauce.

Serve immediately with mustard and ketchup on the side.

## FAQ

### Can I use different types of sausages?

Absolutely! Vienna sausages are traditional, but you can use any mini sausage, cocktail franks, or even cheese-filled sausages for extra indulgence. Some vendors use fish cake (eomuk) instead of sausage—try it if you're feeling adventurous.

### How do I store leftover sotteok sotteok?

Store assembled but uncooked skewers in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. Cooked sotteok sotteok is best eaten immediately, but you can refrigerate and reheat in a pan (not microwave—it makes the rice cakes tough).

### Can I make this in an air fryer?

Yes! Air fry at 180°C (350°F) for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through. Brush with sauce in the last 2 minutes. The air fryer gives excellent crispiness with less oil.

### What if I can't find Korean rice cakes?

Japanese mochi or Chinese nian gao (年糕) work as substitutes, though the texture is different. For the closest experience, look for *garae-tteok* (가래떡)—the long cylindrical rice cakes used for tteokbokki—at Asian grocery stores or online.

### Is sotteok sotteok spicy?

It can be! The spice level depends entirely on your sauce. For a mild version, reduce the gochujang and increase the honey. For kids, skip the gochujang entirely and use a simple ketchup-honey glaze.

### What drinks pair well with sotteok sotteok?

Traditional pairing: banana milk (바나나우유) or Milkis. For adults: cold beer or soju. The sweetness of banana milk especially complements the spicy-sweet sauce.

### Can I grill these outdoors?

Yes, and they're fantastic on a real grill! The smoky char adds another dimension. Just make sure to oil the grates well and watch carefully—the sugary sauce can burn quickly over open flame.

## Make It Tonight

There's a reason Korean street food has conquered the world. It's not about technique or rare ingredients. It's about joy—the simple pleasure of eating something delicious, preferably while walking through a busy market or sitting on plastic stools with friends.

Sotteok sotteok captures that joy in skewer form. It's the kind of food that makes you smile. The kind of food that tastes better when shared. The kind of food that reminds you, as *True Beauty* reminds us, that the best things in life are often the simplest.

Tonight, skip the fancy dinner plans. Make sotteok sotteok instead. Eat it standing at the kitchen counter if you want. Let the sauce get on your fingers. Reach for one more skewer even when you're full.

Because some foods aren't about nutrition or Instagram. They're about happiness.

오늘 밤, *여신강림* 정주행하면서 직접 만든 소떡소떡과 함께하는 건 어떨까요?
